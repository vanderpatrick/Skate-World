# Testing :

Since this is an HTML and CSS project my main concern was the responsiveness of the project while taking into account the validation of the HTML and CSS.

 - The project was built with a desktop approach, with this in mind I never thought how stressful it was to make everything responsive.

 - It was used a lot of media queries to respond not only to general screen sizes but also some for specific sizes.

 # Test Validators :

 ## [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fvanderpatrick.github.io%2FSkate-World%2F)

All Html pages have been tested and passed with success.

 ## [Jigsaw CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvanderpatrick.github.io%2FSkate-World%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

The CSS file has been tested and passed with success.
