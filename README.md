# Testing :

Since this is a HTML and CSS project my main concearn was the responsivenes of the project while taking in account the validation of the html and css.

 - The project was build with a desktop approuch, with this in mind i never thought how stresful it was to make everything responsive.

 - It was used a lot of media quieries to responde not only to general screen sizes but also some for especific sizes.
