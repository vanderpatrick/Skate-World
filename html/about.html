            <p class="bold-text">Skateboarding is an action sport originating in the United States that involves riding
                and performing tricks using a skateboard, as well as a recreational activity, an art form, an
                entertainment industry job, and a method of transportation. Skateboarding has been shaped and
                influenced by many skateboarders throughout the years. A 2009 report found that the skateboarding market
                is worth an estimated $4.8 billion in annual revenue, with 11.08 million active skateboarders in the
                world. In 2016, it was announced that skateboarding will be represented at the 2020 Summer Olympics
                in Tokyo, for both male and female teams.

                Since the 1970s, skateparks have been constructed specifically for use by skateboarders, freestyle
                BMXers, aggressive skaters, and very recently, scooters. However, skateboarding has become
                controversial in areas in which the activity, although illegal, has damaged curbs, stoneworks, steps,
                benches, plazas, and parks.
